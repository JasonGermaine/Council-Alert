# Council Alert

>This project is aimed at reinventing a system to allow users the capability of reporting obscurities to
the council using modern day technology rather than by telephone. This will encourage users to
participate in notifying the council of such obscurities more frequently. This project will also aim to
provide the council access to a web portal in which they can view a list of prioritized reports with
corresponding statistics along with providing automatic dispersal of tasks to council workers. The
idea for this project is to design and implement a multiple platform application with multiple tiers of
access to control function permissions. This project will provide functionality for three main user
groups with functionality catering for each userâ€™s requirements.
